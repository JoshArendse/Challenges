					 <p>The amazing, spectacular, sensational Spider-Man has made his triumphant return to the world of video games (let’s forget about MvC Infinite). Spidey’s last solo game appearance was in the mostly forgotten (and if it’s not forgotten it should be) Amazing Spider-Man 2. Activision tried taking the Spider-Man IP down many roads during it’s time with the licenses, but Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the end of the line. With Activision out, it was time for someone else to take the mantle and Sony stepped in to grab exclusive rights for the PS4 (which I’m sure demanded a king’s ransom) and brought on Insomniac to develop it. So here we are a few years after its surprise e3 announcement and Spider-Man is ready for the masses. Was it worth the wait, or just another poorly constructed superhero game that doesn’t have Arkham in the title?</p>

					 <p>Some background on my superhero likes… Spider-Man is my favorite Marvel hero since I was a little kid, watching the cartoon on FOX Saturday mornings (Batman is my DC favorite for those that wanted to know). So I hold Spider-Man games to a high level and check out pretty much every one released. Shattered Dimensions was the last great Spider-Man game, in my opinion, and that came out eight years ago so we are extremely overdue for a well done web slinger title. Long story short, Spider-Man for the PS4 is a fantastic game and might be my game of the year. Within minutes of starting up the game, you can tell the love and level of knowledge the crew at Insomniac has for Spidey and the city of New York. It’s also immediately noticeable that Insomniac was very influenced by the Arkham series, which is not a bad thing, but also has me wondering if we will ever see another superhero game that doesn’t use similar gameplay mechanics.</p>

					 <p>While combat may feel very similar to Batman games, the Arkham mechanic of countering enemies really fits Spider-Man even more than it should for Batman. You see, Spidey has spider sense which flashes around his head when you should hit the counter button during combat, avoiding bullets, punches, rockets, stun sticks, pretty much any weapon imaginable. The Arkham similarities don’t end there either; you build a combo meter and can even unleash a finishing maneuver once your combo is high enough (which is even performed using the same button combinations as Batman’s finishers). So as many say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but in this case I think Insomniac might have out Rocksteady’d Rocksteady. The combat is fluid and really a blast, and it just gets better as you make your way through the game. Of course, Spider-Man features an upgrade system and with that upgrade system comes new moves for combat and web swinging (even one for performing tricks while swinging around NYC).</p>

					 <p>Not only are you leveling up and getting skill points, but there are plenty (and I mean plenty) of collectibles and other tokens to obtain during your time as your friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Disclosure time; I want to avoid all spoilers for not only the story but also what you collect/obtain. Sony provided me with a review copy of Spider-Man and included a review guide for spoilers that are and aren’t acceptable in reviews. I feel like a true single player experience involves going in fresh and since I don’t know the level at which you, the reader, has experienced Spider-man when it comes to previews, videos and message boards, I will reframe from diving into anything beyond the first few hours. The amount of items to collect and areas to explore just make it so damn easy to get lost in New York City, (and no I don’t mean you can’t find your way around) and that’s without all the story and side missions. One minute you’ll be on your way to meet up at the shelter Aunt May is working at and the next thing you know you just spent an hour taking pictures of Madison Square Garden, stopping a store robbery, finding forgotten backpacks, and much more. There’s no shortage of things to keep the webhead busy.</p>
